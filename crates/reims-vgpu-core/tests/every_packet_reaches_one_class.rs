//! Every packet the ledger admits reaches exactly one payload class's resolver.
//!
//! # Two tables of the same opcodes, and one of them is in another crate
//!
//! [`classify`] says which class a packet is, and each class has its own way in:
//! a lifecycle command through `lifecycle::operation`, a question through
//! `query::request_words`, a frame through `present::resolve`, a control command
//! through `control::resolve`, and GPU work through the stream walker.
//!
//! Three of those ask `classify` before answering, so for them the partition is
//! enforced at its source and what this census pins is a different thing: that
//! each kind's own arm list — twelve opcodes for lifecycle, four for query,
//! twenty-three for control — *is* `classify`'s arm list for that class. Those
//! are two tables of the same numbers, and a row moved in one and not the other
//! is a packet with a class and no kind, which is admitted and then has nothing
//! to do with itself.
//!
//! [`PresentForm::of`] asks nothing. It lives in the protocol crate, which
//! cannot see `classify` at all, so its three opcodes are a genuinely
//! independent table — and this is the only thing that compares them. The exec
//! opcode is the same case: the walker is handed a payload rather than asked
//! whether it wants one, so the only thing naming it is `classify` and the
//! literal here.
//!
//! # The cutover half
//!
//! A row the ledger has not closed gets no class, and nothing may claim it: a
//! resolver that took one would be this device acting on a contract the ledger
//! says is not established. That is the direction the open rows are counted in,
//! and it is checked for every row rather than for the ones anyone remembered.
//!
//! # What is not claimed
//!
//! That the resolvers *succeed*. Most are handed a zero payload here, and a
//! command whose operation is not in its own packet — see
//! `ResolveRefusal::NeedsStorage` and `NeedsGuestTable` — names what is missing
//! rather than producing one. Claiming the packet is the question; what the
//! answer is belongs to each owner's own tests.
