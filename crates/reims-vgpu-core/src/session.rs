//! Ingress: the one place a packet becomes a transaction, or does not become
//! one at all.
//!
//! # Refusal happens here or it happens too late
//!
//! A packet whose contract is not established must be refused *before* it is
//! given an ingress ordinal, an ordering position and a completion obligation.
//! Once it has those, every mechanism downstream will honour them — the hazard
//! compiler will order against its accesses, the scheduler will hold work for
//! its stamp, and something will eventually have to publish a completion for
//! work that was never described. A refusal at ingress costs the guest one
//! command; a refusal after admission costs it the channel.
//!
//! So [`SessionModel::admit`] decides in one place, from the closure ledger,
//! and the refusal it returns names which of the reasons applied.
//!
//! # What a session owns and what it does not
//!
//! It owns the ordinal counters, the per-channel sequences, the hazard graph,
//! the readiness service and each channel's publication order. It owns no
//! resources, no pipelines and no host objects, and it cannot: those live
//! behind a lease whose identity carries this session's generation, and the
//! crate they live in is not this one.
