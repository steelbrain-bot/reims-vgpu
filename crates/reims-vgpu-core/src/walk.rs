//! From a guest's command-stream bytes to one transaction.
//!
//! # The link that was missing
//!
//! [`crate::exec::ExecBuilder`] takes `begin_segment`, `record`, `end_segment`
//! and `finish`, in wire order, and produces the only [`ExecWork`] this
//! crate can make. Every one of those calls had to come from somewhere, and
//! until this module the only somewhere was a test calling them by hand. So the
//! model could resolve a record and could place a record, and had no way to be
//! handed a stream.
//!
//! [`exec`] is that way. It is the whole path — bytes, segments, records,
//! operations, accesses, transaction — and it is one function because every
//! seam inside it is a place where two halves could disagree about where a
//! record was, which is exactly the class of defect the replacement exists to
//! remove.
//!
//! # It owns none of the four parses it drives
//!
//! Segments come from [`reims_vgpu_protocol::segment::SegmentStream`]. Records
//! come from `reims_vgpu_wire::op::OpStream`, through the protocol crate's
//! re-export. Meaning comes from [`crate::resolve::operation`]. Placement,
//! ordering and access derivation come from the builder. This module contains
//! no byte arithmetic at all; it is the composition, and the reason it is worth
//! writing down separately is that the composition is where a rail can be taken
//! from the wrong place.
//!
//! The rail is the segment's. `resolve::operation` is handed a rail rather than
//! deriving one, and the only defensible source for it is the encoder class the
//! guest wrote the record into —
//! [`reims_vgpu_protocol::segment::SegmentKind::rail`], from the type byte in
//! the header immediately above the record. Taking it from anywhere else, such
//! as a previous segment or a per-packet default, reads one encoder's commands
//! as another's.
//!
//! # A record that does not resolve refuses the transaction
//!
//! Not the record — the transaction. Dropping one record and executing the rest
//! is a wrong frame presented as a right one: a draw without its pipeline, a
//! blit without its barrier. The closure ledger is what makes this a schedule
//! rather than a wall, and it already says so —
//! [`reims_vgpu_protocol::closure::Closure::blocks_cutover`] holds for every
//! unresolved row, so a stream refusing here while rows remain open is the
//! ledger's prediction rather than a surprise.
//!
//! # An encoder is not a segment
//!
//! A guest may split one encoder across several segments, and the contract for
//! it is established rather than guessed: the `beginSegment:` `BOOL` lands at
//! `+5` of the header it opens, and the serializer then reaches *back* into the
//! preceding header to mark `+6`. The two are one edge recorded from both ends
//! — "this segment continues the encoder above" and "that encoder continues
//! below" — which is why one non-zero byte cannot be read for the direction,
//! and why [`reims_vgpu_protocol::segment::SegmentLifetime`] is one value
//! rather than two bools a seam could split.
//!
//! This module does nothing with it beyond passing it whole.
//! [`crate::stream::StreamCursor`] holds the encoder, so it is the cursor that
//! decides whether a segment's end ends anything, and the walker's loop is the
//! same either way. That is the point of the split: a walker that knew when an
//! encoder survives would be a second copy of the encoder state machine.
