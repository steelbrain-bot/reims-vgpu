//! The resource-lifecycle transaction: every packet in the class, and what it
//! does to the owners of names, storage and content.
//!
//! # Why the class needs a vocabulary of its own
//!
//! [`crate::transaction::PayloadClass::ResourceLifecycle`] is one of five
//! payload classes and the only one whose members do genuinely different
//! things: a delete retires a name, a synchronise owes a copy, a discard
//! *offers* to drop one. Collapsing them into "the lifecycle packet" and
//! branching on the opcode at the point of use is how the replaced
//! architecture ended up with a partial mechanism per command. So the class has
//! an exhaustive resolved vocabulary — [`LifecycleOp`] — and
//! [`LifecycleKind::of`] is checked against the closure ledger so that "every
//! lifecycle packet has an operation" is a test rather than a claim.
//!
//! # Each command's effect is the ledger's reading of it, and not more
//!
//! - `CmdInvalidateResources` says the device's cached view of the guest's
//!   pages is stale. That is not a discard of a copy: it means the guest's
//!   pages are the current content and ours is not, which is exactly a write
//!   recorded in [`Replica::GuestPages`]. Recording it as a discard would leave
//!   the device replica able to claim freshness at the old version.
//! - `CmdSynchronizeResources` says the guest is about to read the pages with
//!   its CPU, so every write already submitted must have executed *before the
//!   packet completes*. It therefore owes copies, and those copies are the
//!   transaction's completion obligation rather than something a later read
//!   discovers.
//! - `CmdDiscardResources` releases a transfer copy that a later prepare or
//!   synchronise recreates. It is a hint: the ledger's reading is that ignoring
//!   it costs memory and not correctness. So a discard whose bytes exist in no
//!   other replica is *declined* and named, because taking it would not free a
//!   spare copy — it would destroy content.
//! - `CmdSynchronizeAndDiscardResources` is the two of them in that order, and
//!   the order is the whole point: after the synchronise the guest holds the
//!   bytes, so the discard has a second holder and is never the declined kind.
//!
//! # A discard happens at completion, because submission is not completion
//!
//! Both discard forms come back in [`Effects::at_completion`] rather than being
//! applied when the packet is admitted. A discard applied at admission would
//! mark the device replica stale while the copies that make that safe are still
//! owed, and a read admitted in between would be planned against freshness that
//! does not exist yet. [`Lifecycle::complete`] is where content authority
//! actually moves, and it re-asks the sole-authority question at that point
//! rather than trusting an answer computed earlier.
//!
//! # Nothing is half-applied
//!
//! The four content commands name a list of resources. Every name in the list
//! is resolved before any of them takes effect, so a list with one stale name
//! refuses whole. A caller that saw a refusal after three of five resources had
//! been invalidated would have no way to describe the state it was left in.
