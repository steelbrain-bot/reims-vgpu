//! The transaction envelope: what every accepted packet is, before anything
//! knows how a host would execute it.
//!
//! # One shape for GPU and non-GPU work
//!
//! A draw is not the unit of scheduling here and neither is an EXEC. Every
//! accepted FIFO packet is an ordered device transaction with the same
//! envelope: channel identity, a channel-local sequence, an ingress ordinal,
//! explicit prerequisites, a completion obligation, and one typed payload. A
//! resource delete, a display present and an EXEC differ in their payload and
//! in nothing else, because ordering and publication are owed to all three
//! equally — and the architecture this replaces gave each of them its own
//! partial mechanism.
//!
//! # Five payloads, and no catch-all among them
//!
//! [`PayloadClass::Control`] is the one that could rot into a bucket, so the
//! rule is written into [`classify`] and checked: a command may be `Control`
//! only when its established contract is a real control operation or an
//! acknowledged no-op. A command whose contract is *unknown* has no class at
//! all — it is a typed refusal at ingress, not a `Control` that quietly does
//! nothing — and [`crate::identity`]'s ordering guarantees never apply to work
//! that was never accepted.
//!
//! That rule is not enforceable by reading this file, so it is enforced against
//! the closure ledger: every packet class the ledger has judged maps to exactly
//! one payload, and every class it has *not* judged maps to none.
