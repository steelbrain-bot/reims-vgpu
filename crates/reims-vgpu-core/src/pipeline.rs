//! The pipeline lifetime, and the rule that a draw never compiles.
//!
//! # Why this is a state machine and not a cache
//!
//! A pipeline that is compiled lazily on first use is a pipeline whose
//! compilation cost lands on a draw — and a draw is the one place in this
//! architecture that may not block, wait on a host, or discover work. Making
//! the lifetime explicit moves the cost to where the guest actually asked for
//! it: the object-creation packet starts the work, and a transaction that wants
//! the pipeline holds a lease and is not ready until the lease resolves.
//!
//! So "not compiled yet" is a state a transaction can wait on rather than a
//! cache miss a draw has to handle, and "refused" is a state rather than an
//! error return that some call sites check and others do not.
//!
//! # Refused is terminal and says why
//!
//! A pipeline the device cannot build does not retry on the next draw. It stays
//! refused for the lifetime of the object, with the reason attached, so a guest
//! re-binding it every frame produces one refusal rather than one per frame —
//! and so that the reason survives to whoever reads the failure channel.
//!
//! # What this crate cannot see
//!
//! Nothing here names a shader, a module, a descriptor layout or a native
//! handle. The translation and compilation *happen* somewhere that does; this
//! owns when they may start, what a waiting transaction observes, and when the
//! result may be dropped.
