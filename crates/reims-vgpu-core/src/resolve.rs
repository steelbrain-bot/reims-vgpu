//! Turning a decoded record into a resolved operation.
//!
//! # This is the second of decode's two questions, and it is answered once
//!
//! `reims_vgpu_protocol::decode` answers *what did the guest write* and hands
//! back records with the guest's own `u32` refs still on them. This module
//! answers *which object does each ref name*, which is a question about device
//! state, and it is the only place that answers it. A decoder that resolved
//! refs would have to borrow live device state to read a record; a model that
//! resolved them a second time downstream could get a different answer than the
//! one the operation was planned against. The whole replacement exists partly
//! to delete that second shape.
//!
//! # A ref that names nothing is a refusal, not a zero
//!
//! [`ResourceId`] carries a generation, so a guest that deletes an object and
//! creates another in the same slot produces an id the old work no longer
//! matches. Resolution is where that check happens: a ref with no live object
//! refuses by name and the operation never enters the model. Substituting a
//! null id would put an operation into the stream that names something that
//! does not exist, and the dependency graph would then order real work against
//! it.
//!
//! # Counted lists go to the arena, not into the operation
//!
//! A barrier's resource list is guest-sized. The operation names a window of
//! the transaction's arena — two `u32` — so one arena serves every class that
//! carries a list and no operation is as large as the largest list anyone sent.
//! Appending is the only copy in the path, and it copies resolved ids rather
//! than guest bytes.
