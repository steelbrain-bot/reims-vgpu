//! Answers one design question and nothing else: **may the host-window present
//! run on a thread that is not the window's event-loop thread?**
//!
//! That question gates the last large piece of the replacement cutover. The
//! present is the only path that still needs `&mut ResourcePools` from the
//! window thread, and `pools` cannot follow `caches` onto the device until the
//! whole present is a transaction run by the thread that owns the device — the
//! drain. `window_present_frame`'s own docs record what that move would cost in
//! schedule and lock time (nothing, and about a millisecond a second), and then
//! say what was *not* established: the acquire has to happen before the blit can
//! be recorded, and it is the window's surface that owns the swapchain. Whether
//! the platform's WSI tolerates being driven from another thread was left open,
//! and designing around a guess is how a rail acquires an intermittent hang.
//!
//! # What this runs
//!
//! The window is opened by [`spawn`] exactly as a boot opens it, on its own
//! event-loop thread, with a frame slot that is **never published to**. The
//! loop's `needs_present` gate therefore lets it present once — the first-frame
//! forced redraw — and then goes quiet for the rest of the run. Every present
//! after that comes from this file's own thread, through the same
//! `Backend::window_present` entry the window thread calls.
//!
//! So a clean run is a rail that acquired a drawable, recorded and submitted a
//! blit, and called `vkQueuePresentKHR` several hundred times from a thread that
//! is not the one that created the surface — which is the shape the move needs.
//!
//! It names the Vulkan rail on purpose. The question is about one rail's WSI,
//! and `AGENTS.md`'s rule for a test whose answer is a rail's is to name that
//! rail rather than ask a `cfg` which arm was compiled.
//!
//! ```text
//! REIMS_VGPU_PROBE_SECONDS=6 cargo run -p reims-vgpu \
//!     --example window_present_off_thread \
//!     --no-default-features --features backend-vulkan,host-window
//! ```
//!
//! # What a clean run does *not* establish
//!
//! One host, one WSI platform, one driver. The pathway table carries a Linux
//! Vulkan rail and two Apple ones, and MoltenVK's drawable acquisition is a
//! different implementation with different thread rules — a pass here is
//! evidence about the platform it ran on and about nothing else. Run it on the
//! other host before designing for the other host.
//!
//! # Swapchain recreation, which is the other half of the question
//!
//! Presenting is the frequent WSI call; recreating is the dangerous one. It
//! destroys and rebuilds a `VkSwapchainKHR` against a surface the compositor and
//! the event loop both still own, and a present-only probe would have missed it
//! entirely. So every `REIMS_VGPU_PROBE_RECREATE_EVERY` frames (default 30) the
//! probe thread toggles the presenter's desired extent, which arms
//! `recreate_pending`, and the *next off-thread present* is the one that
//! destroys and rebuilds the swapchain. The reported `recreates` count is how
//! many times that was asked for.
//!
//! Whether the requested extent is honoured is not the point and is not asserted
//! — Wayland reports a `currentExtent` the driver clamps to, and the native
//! window is never actually resized here. The point is that the destroy/create
//! pair ran on the wrong thread and the rail kept presenting afterwards.
