//! The render-rail records the closure ledger has **not settled**.
//!
//! Thirty-one opcodes, in six families: the five patch draws, the two
//! `executeCommandsInBuffer:` forms, the six `writeDescriptor` pass-property
//! records, the three store-action-options records, the two tessellation
//! records, and the twelve vertex-amplification and tile-shader records.
//!
//! # Why they are decoded here and not in `reims-vgpu-protocol`
//!
//! An unresolved row has no established contract, so the layer that assigns
//! meaning to a wire tag may not give it a shape.
//! `reims_vgpu_protocol::render::RenderKind` names exactly the forty-five rows
//! the ledger has settled and `decode::render` lifts those; `of_opcode`
//! answering `None` is the ledger's own statement that a row is not closed, and
//! it is the routing question `runtime::exec::handle_render_record` asks.
//!
//! # Three different reasons a row is here, and they are not the same claim
//!
//! **Two rows drive real work.** `executeCommandsInBuffer:` in both its forms
//! pushes onto `StreamAccum::execute_icb` and is executed at end of stream by
//! `runtime::icb`. Those two are `Implemented` in the ledger and unsettled only
//! in the sense that no protocol record covers them yet — the compute rail's
//! own pair is in the same position, and [`super::compute_spi`] says so too.
//!
//! **Four rows are refused by contract.** `setColorStoreActionOptions:` and its
//! depth and stencil siblings, and `writeDescriptor`'s
//! `defaultRasterSampleCount`, are `Closure::Refused`. They are decoded here
//! rather than answered from `decode::no_record` because the *value* is the
//! evidence: a refusal that says which options word or which sample count the
//! guest asked for is what will settle whether the row needs implementing, and
//! a bare `RefusedByContract` says only that a record arrived.
//!
//! **The rest are declined pending evidence**, in the shape
//! [`super::blit_spi`] describes: nothing downstream tessellates, amplifies
//! vertices or runs a tile shader, so no field they carry has a consumer, and
//! the decline's count is the measurement that will settle the row. What is
//! lifted is what the *census* needs — which form, and whether the guest asked
//! for anything other than the API default — and nothing more. A field with no
//! consumer is a producer this module would have to keep correct for nobody.
//!
//! # It refuses every settled opcode by name
//!
//! No record on this rail has two readings. A settled row reaching [`decode`]
//! is [`DecodeStatus::ErrSettledElsewhere`], not a record — the routing in
//! `runtime::exec::handle_render_record` disagreeing with the ledger, and it is
//! named rather than answered a second time.
