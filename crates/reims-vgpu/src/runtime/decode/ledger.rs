//! Does the closure ledger describe *these* decoders?
//!
//! `reims_vgpu_protocol::closure` records one outcome per decodable operation,
//! and its own tests keep the row set equal to the serializer's selector
//! manifest. Neither of those touches this crate. So the ledger could say a
//! render opcode is implemented while this rail's decoder refuses it as
//! unknown, and nothing would notice: one is a statement about the protocol,
//! the other is a match arm, and until now they were only ever read by people.
//!
//! These tests are the join. They drive the real per-rail decoders across every
//! ledger row and assert the two agree about which operations exist. They say
//! nothing about whether an outcome is the *right* one — no test can — only
//! that the ledger and the decoders are describing the same opcode space.
//!
//! # What "recognised" means here
//!
//! Each rail refuses an opcode outside its own accepted window with a distinct
//! status (`ErrUnknownOpcode`, `ErrUnsupportedOpcode`), separately from
//! refusing a record whose payload is too short for its layout (`ErrShort`,
//! `ErrBadLength`). Only the first pair is a claim about the opcode, so that is
//! what is asserted: a generously sized zero payload is offered and the decoder
//! may still refuse its *contents*, because a record of zeroes is not a record
//! any of these selectors would actually write.
