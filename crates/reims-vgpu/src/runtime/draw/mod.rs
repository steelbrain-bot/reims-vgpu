//! It was `metal_draw` until the composition was counted. The gated Vulkan half
//! (`vulkan.rs`) is the largest file here by a factor of two, and the
//! backend-independent halves — `texture_view`, `render_target`, and this
//! file's own bind materialization — run on both arms on every draw. Only
//! `metal_icb` and `depth_stencil` are genuinely Metal-side, and both carry
//! their own gates.
//!
//! The fail-log event names emitted from this file (`metal_draw MissingPipeline`
//! and its siblings) and the counters that count them (`metal_draws_ok`,
//! `metal_draws_fail`) deliberately kept their spelling through that rename.
//! They are operator-facing vocabulary that appears in already-recorded
//! measurements, so respelling them would silently invalidate every reading
//! taken before it. The module path and the log vocabulary are two different
//! names, and only one of them was wrong.

/// spelled the settle alone. All four go through
/// [`crate::runtime::writeback_debt::settle_for_texture`] now, so there is one
/// copy of the rule rather than four.
///
/// The difference is not academic. A settle waits for writes this device has
/// already **submitted**; a writeback debt is a frame it rendered and

/// settle to find and it returns immediately with the owed frame still sitting
/// in a host resident. The guest's own bytes are then one Store behind, and the
/// bind that reads them is a sampled texture — an icon, a glyph atlas, a blurred
/// backdrop — which is the shape this failure takes on screen.
///
/// `buffer_ref` is threaded down for exactly this: the payment is by name, and
/// the name is the buffer whose bytes are about to be read.
/// [`load_buffer_texture_rgba`] pays for its texture reference as well, because a
/// buffer-backed texture is two contract references over one allocation and
/// either may be the one a debt was armed under.
///
/// Narrowed on the buffer's own span, so the vertex and index reads that reach
/// here — none of which a render Store ever writes — do not start paying for a

///
/// `extent_cap` is the shader's proven reach, exactly as

/// disagreement between the guest's two declarations — it cannot see the
/// texture's declaration at all. What it reports is the passes that end up
/// multisampled, and where their samples are meant to go.
///
/// That matters because it has a downstream cost the site cannot see. The
/// engine creates the resident at the promoted count, the draw succeeds, and
/// then `resident_read_snapshot` refuses to read a `sample_count != 1` resident
/// back — so nothing is stored, `runtime::exec::finish_stream` applies the
/// pass's clear, and a rendered tile reaches the guest as a flat colour. On
/// the Vulkan rail that is measured at twice per boot on 300x300 targets, and until
/// the skipped-draw tail was corrected it was reported as an engine refusal
/// that never happened.
///
/// Measured on rail macos-15, boot s4: **two** records in a whole boot, both
/// `pipeline_samples=4 resolve_ref=0 store=0x1` on 300x300 linear GVA targets,
/// and they are the same two passes the corrected skipped-draw tail reports as
/// `engine_drew_store_lost_it`. Two out of a boot's several hundred pipelines
/// is also what says the pipeline's count is decoded correctly rather than
/// misread: `raster_sample_count` comes from a TLV tag, and a misread tag would
/// not be this rare.
///
/// So the guest really does run a 4x pass here, and the open question is no
/// longer "who invented the multisample" — it is **what the guest expects to
/// find in those guest pages afterwards**. Metal writes nothing to a linear
/// buffer for a multisample `MTLStoreActionStore`; this device writes the
/// pass's clear colour there. Neither this record nor any other establishes
/// which the guest reads, and until one does, no repair here is supportable.

            //
            // Both failures are in the deliberately racy heavy 1920x1080 blit

            // exist "so the GPU is still working when the copy behind them is
            // decoded". The mechanism is cost, not staleness: `gvaseed_chained`
            // is unchanged between the arms (195-347 control against 176-308

            // elisions -- it is paying ~15 extra full-frame `seed_color_load`
            // CPU reads per battery, and that latency is enough to flip cases
            // built to race.
            //
            // # A cost-negative variant was also built, and it hung too
            //
            // The obvious answer to "the CPU seed is what costs" is to preserve
            // from the resident instead: the price of preserving is the seed
            // *upload*, and when the pixels are already in the engine resident
            // there is nothing to upload -- `PassKey`'s seeded arm spells
            // `vk::AttachmentLoadOp::LOAD` against the attachment's existing
            // layout, which is what `chain_load_from_target` already does for a
            // render chain. That arm costs strictly *less* than the branch it
            // replaces: it removes a full-surface clear write and adds no read.
            // It is lawful for DontCare specifically, because undefined permits
            // any contents, so a resident that is stale against a guest CPU
            // write needs none of the currency reconciliation a LOAD would.
            //
            // It was implemented in `draw::vulkan`'s seedless-DontCare arm,
            // scoped to GVA targets, and it worked: one battery measured
            // `dontcare_resident_preserved` 47, `dontcare_resident_absent` 12,
            // and `draw_partial_preserving_unseeded` down from ~78 to 5.
            //
            // **And it hung in exactly the same place** --
            // `srt_blit_after_render_1920x1080`, rc=124 after the 600 s probe
            // timeout, immediately after `srt_blit_after_render_1024x768`
            // passed, the identical signature the seed variant produced.
            //
            // That is the reading to carry forward, because it retires the
            // latency explanation the seed variant suggested. Two variants with
            // opposite cost profiles -- one adding full-frame CPU reads, one
            // removing full-surface clear writes -- hang at the same case. So
            // either routing a DontCare GVA pass to preserve *by any door*
            // disturbs that case, or the case is flaky and both candidates were
            // unlucky. The counts do not separate those: 3 anomalies across 8
            // candidate batteries against 0 across 4 control batteries, which
            // is suggestive and not significant.
            //
            // Whoever takes this next should establish which, and the cheapest
            // way is to bound the control: run the control battery enough times
            // to give `srt_blit_after_render_1920x1080` a fair chance to hang on
            // its own. A control hang settles it as inherited raciness in a case
            // whose own source says its repeated whole-target draws exist "so
            // the GPU is still working when the copy behind them is decoded".
            // Absent that, the mechanism has to be understood before either
            // variant can land -- start from the hung run's device log, where
            // the device is idle (`drain_duty duty=0.002`, no submissions, no
            // typed failure) behind a `stamp_wait_timeout` on a 2.6 s
            // `gpu_span busy_max_us`, and a control run reached the same
            // escalated stamp pattern without hanging.
            //
            // # The shape that was taken
            //
            // `PassKey.load_seed` was a `bool` and the contract it represents
            // has three values: preserve, clear to the guest's colour, and
            // undefined. Two collapsed onto `false` and `caches.rs` resolved
            // `false` to `CLEAR`. It is now
            // `backend::vulkan::engine::caches::Color0Load`, and a seedless
            // preserving pass keys to `Undefined` and resolves to
            // `vk::AttachmentLoadOp::DONT_CARE` against the attachment's
            // resting layout -- lawful, writing none of the attachment, and
            // *cheaper* than the full-surface clear it replaces, so it removes
            // the invented colour without adding the latency that flipped those
            // cases.
            //
            // This arm is therefore left comparing an ordinal on purpose. It
            // decides whether to spend a CPU seed read, and that is the cost
            // the two withdrawn variants were withdrawn for; the colour the
            // guest never supplied is no longer downstream of it. What remains
            // open is the cost-negative preserving arm: when the engine
            // resident already holds this target's contents, the request could

        // this one stored.
        //
        // The ref door only answers for the allocation its pixels came from.

        // A LOAD seed is the attachment's *prior content*, and the matching Store
        // writes the composite back — so a door that hands the pass another

        // above asks whether that address still names the same pages. The ref
        // door's key is an object-list slot the guest reuses, and its entry
        // carries no page identity, so `source_gva` — the address the producing
        // Store rendered into — is the only thing that can separate "the GVA
        // entry aged out of its byte cap and this is the same allocation" from
        // "the guest re-pointed this texture and this is the previous one".
        //

        // same reason, and so is a target with no address of its own: neither can
        // establish that these are this attachment's bytes. Refusing costs a
        // guest re-read below (`load_sampled_rgba_static`), never a lost seed —
        // the guest's own pages are the authoritative source and any deferred
        // window over this address was already landed at the top of this
        // function.
        //
        // Measured on a driven x86/Vulkan boot: the ref door was asked twice in
        // 3 066 seeds and held nothing both times, so the population this gates
        // is small on this pathway. It is not measurable on Metal from here —
        // `host_cache_store_gva_layer` is Vulkan-only, but the compute mirror in
        // `surface_cache::mirror_linear_color_cache` is not — which is why this
        // is a currency test rather than the removal the zero would otherwise
        // invite.
        // The GVA door's own admission test. `has_gva` answers "is there an
        // entry of this geometry"; it does not answer "is this entry this
        // task's, and does its address still name the pages it was stored
        // over". Those are the two the ref door has always been gated on in
        // spirit, and `gva_seed_verdict`'s doc records why the argument that the
        // GVA key *is* the allocation does not survive contact with a second
        // address space.
        // `has_gva` stays the existence gate — is there an entry of this
        // geometry — and the verdict only ever *removes* one from the door.
        //
        // It removes on **positive evidence** and nothing else: another task's
        // address space, or an address the guest has re-pointed. `Unmapped` and
        // `Unrecorded` keep serving, which is not laxity. `GvaBackingState`'s own

/// [`CurrencyStandard::WatchedAndUnwritten`] is what makes that safe on a

///
/// Only a *direct* mapper-ref-texture reference. A texture view onto a
/// mapper-ref-texture base resolves through `load_sampled_rgba_static`'s view
/// rung and is not asked about here, because the view's format override can
/// reinterpret the storage and the cache entry records no such reinterpretation.
///
/// The order against `load_sampled_rgba_static`'s own first rung is safe by

/// Two callers ask this and they ask it for different reasons — one wants the
