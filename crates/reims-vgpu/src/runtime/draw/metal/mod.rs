//! The Metal rail's draw encode: a [`DrawEncodeRequest`] into `MTLRenderCommandEncoder`.
//!
//! The sibling of [`super::vulkan`], and the two are deliberately shaped alike:
//! each owns one `encode_draw_chain` with the same signature, each translates
//! the backend-neutral request its parent built, and neither is reachable except
//! through [`crate::backend::Backend`]. Everything here names a Metal ABI type,
//! an `MTL*` ordinal or a host-side attachment buffer that only this rail keeps.
//!
//! This lived in [`super`] behind a `cfg` on every item. What that cost was not
//! readability: the Vulkan rail's items were re-exported *flat* into
//! `runtime::draw`, so both rails spelled their entry point
//! `runtime::draw::encode_draw_chain` and a build could only ever contain one of
//! them. Naming this rail is what lets a single binary carry both and run one
//! guest stream through each.
