/// What this rail does *not* take is the other half —
/// `draw::gva_resident_if_current`, the currency test the single-sample

/// anything has written the target's guest pages since the Store, making the
/// resident stale against them. A multisample target has no such second copy:
/// no rail of this device writes a multisample target's guest pages, and this
/// device is the only reader of them. With nothing to compare, the witness
/// cannot answer — it reports no observed write rather than a quiet span — and

/// protecting nothing. The hazard it stands in for on other rails, an absent or
/// unready resident, is carried here by the engine's own `MultisampleSample*`
/// declines at bind time.
///
/// The target's own geometry comes from `draw::color_target_request`, which is
