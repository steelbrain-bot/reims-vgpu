//! Product-path compute bind/dispatch for `SEGMENT_TYPE_COMPUTE`.
//!
//! Executable surface:
//! - `0xd0` set compute pipeline (serializer-object → kernel function MTLB + optional stage-input)
//! - `0xcb` / `0xd9` set buffers (+ optional attribute stride for dynamic stage-input layouts)
//! - `0xcf` / `0xda` set buffer offset (+ optional attribute stride)
//! - `0xce` set textures (normal-texture GVA + mapper-ref-texture; sample vs storage via reflection)
//! - `0xcc` / `0xcd` set samplers (+ optional LOD clamp)
//! - `0xd1` direct stage-in region / `0xd2` indirect stage-in region (guest buffer args)
//! - `0xd3` threadgroup memory length
//! - `0xd8` imageblock dimensions
//! - `0xc8`/`0xca` direct dispatch; `0xc9`/`0xe6` indirect (guest args → direct encode)
//! - `0xdb` dispatch type (serial/concurrent)
//!
//! Fences: stream walk (`fence_exec`). Control-flow (`0xdc`–`0xe2`) encodes
//! host Metal SPI on a multi-record [`crate::runtime::compute_session`] (same
//! encoder for the segment). ICB (`0xe4`/`0xe5`) materializes type-7 `0x36` and
//! executes filled host command slots (CPU fill via [`crate::runtime::icb`];
//! stream fill opcodes remain unknown). Nested dispatches on an open session
//! encode onto that encoder (inside SPI); writeback runs after session commit.
//! Barriers and compressed-texture flush are ordered no-ops.
//!
//! One-shot encode uses [`crate::backend::metal::compute::compute_core`]; nested
//! encode uses `compute_encode_on_encoder`. Buffer and storage-image writeback

///   refusal that could never fire, because the only producer feeding it had
