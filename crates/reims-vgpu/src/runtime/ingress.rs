//! From a packet this device drained to a packet the semantic model admits.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! [`crate::runtime::drain`] takes bytes out of a ring and produces a
//! [`drain::Packet`]: an opcode, a record array, a completion word and a
//! payload. [`reims_vgpu_core::session::SessionModel`] admits a
//! [`reims_vgpu_core::session::Packet`]: an ordering domain, a semantic
//! lifetime, typed stamps and a resolved [`Payload`]. Those are the two ends of
//! the cutover and **nothing joined them** — the model could describe every
//! packet this device receives and could be handed none of them.
//!
//! This is that join. It touches no guest memory and mutates nothing;
//! everything it cannot answer it returns as a named [`Gap`] rather than
//! approximating, so the set of classes that can cross today is a value a test
//! can assert rather than a claim a reader has to believe.
//!
//! It is **not** a pure function of the drained packet, and stopped being one
//! the moment the first namespace gap closed. A ref, a mapping id and a page
//! frame are numbers whose meaning lives in a namespace, and a bridge that
//! could not consult one could only ever carry the classes that name nothing —
//! which is what [`Gap`] was a list of. So the namespaces arrive as
//! [`Resolvers`]: a bundle rather than a parameter each, because every
//! remaining gap closes by *adding a resolver*, and a bundle makes that a field
//! rather than another signature change rippling through every caller.
//!
//! # The gaps are closed, and what closed them is worth keeping
//!
//! What crosses used to be "what resolves from the packet's own bytes", and
//! [`Gap`] was the list of classes that did not. That list is now empty of
//! everything but an unsettled ledger row.
//!
//! **The class was never the unit, and that is what naming the gaps bought.**
//! The resource-lifetime class was three different partitions in three commits,
//! and each coarser name was hiding a member that did not belong to it.
//! "Lifetime commands need a namespace" was false of the two that name a task
//! and nothing inside it; once the namespaces landed it was false of all
//! twelve, and what the rest were short of was the *access* each named resource
//! takes — a different missing thing with a different owner. A gap that
//! over-claims is one nobody thinks to close; a gap that closes and leaves its
//! name behind is one everybody thinks is closed.
//!
//! The four that closed, and what each of them turned out to need:
//!
//! - **Query** resolves its reply destination through [`Resolvers::replies`],
//!   in whichever address space its own question uses. Every route this device
//!   interns on draws from one monotone counter, so a page frame identified as
//!   a page frame can equal no window and no mapping by construction. See
//!   [`query_payload`].
//! - **Present** resolves its target as a mapping, and the frame it shows is
//!   the whole of that mapping's surface — so the access is an
//!   `AccessKey::Whole` over the resolved backing and nothing about it is
//!   approximated. See [`present_payload`] for the one case that is still
//!   imprecise and why the imprecision is the honest answer there.
//! - **Exec** needed three inputs and not the two its walk's signature shows:
//!   an object-list resolver, an access source, and the command stream *bytes*,
//!   which live at guest addresses the payload names rather than in the
//!   payload. The first two are `reims_vgpu_core::lifecycle::Lifecycle`'s and
//!   became production state with the resource-lifecycle group's cutover; the
//!   third is a page-table walk and stays the caller's, because it is
//!   guest-memory work and not translation. See [`ExecStreams`].
//! - **The re-point** — the twelfth lifetime command, and the last of all — is
//!   short of pages that are not in its packet at all. Its identity resolves in
//!   the model and its storage arrives from the device that has just moved the
//!   storage incarnation, which is why those two halves come from two places.
//!   See [`ReplacementStorage`].
//!
//! Both of the last two arrive as [`DeviceInputs`], which is the shape the
//! remaining work has: not a namespace this bridge could consult, but a value
//! whose *ordering* against this device's own state is the caller's to get
//! right. What is left in [`Gap`] is [`Gap::Unresolved`] alone — a ledger row
//! whose contract is not settled — which is a question about the guest's
//! interface and not about this join.
//!
//! # Every packet carries a completion word
//!
//! [`reims_vgpu_core::session::Packet::completion`] is an `Option`, because a
//! model may have packets that publish nothing. **This interface does not**:
//! the drain writes the header's completion word into the channel's stamp slot
//! for every packet it processes, and a packet that does not advance the fence
//! repeats the slot's current value rather than leaving it alone. Repeating is
//! idempotent and a wait decided against a repeat is decided the same way it
//! was before, so "does not signal" and "signals the value already there" are
//! the same event on the wire. This bridge therefore always produces `Some`,
//! and `None` stays available for a model that has the other case.
//!
//! # The slot is the channel's and the value is the packet's
//!
//! A `drain::Packet` carries a completion *value* and no slot. The slot belongs
//! to the FIFO — the root's is slot 0 and a child's is read once per drain from
//! its register block — so it arrives here as an argument. Wait records carry
//! their own raw index, masked to a slot by
//! [`stamp_slot_index`], which is the one place that mask is applied.

/// have read as closed the day the namespaces landed. It closes on
/// [`ReplacementStorage`], which is the caller's half of that refusal.
///
/// `SetObjectList` used to be beside it and is not any more. Its operation was
/// held to be the per-entry result of walking the guest's table; a driven boot
/// measured the walk at 1 048 576 declared entries per bind against about
