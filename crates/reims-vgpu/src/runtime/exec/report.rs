//! How the exec rail reports what it did, refused and dropped.
//!
//! Every function here **decides nothing**. Each one takes a fact the rail has
//! already established and turns it into a census route, a fail line, a typed
//! refusal, or a first-sight latch — and returns either nothing or the latch's
//! own answer. That is the whole membership rule, and it is why these can sit
//! together despite reporting unrelated things: `mod.rs` is then the rail, and
//! this is what the rail says about itself.
//!
//! Some of it is measurement (`note_pass_extent_coverage` bands what a pass
//! covered) and some is lost guest work (`note_clear_dropped`,
//! `note_draw_encode_fail`). Both belong here for the same reason; neither
//! changes what the rail does next.
//!
//! Not to be confused with `crate::observe`, which is the crate-wide emission
//! machinery these call into, or with `runtime/census/`, whose module doc
//! reserves that directory for something else.
