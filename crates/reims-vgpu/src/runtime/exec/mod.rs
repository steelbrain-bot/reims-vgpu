/// none. So most records name resources that have no surface state to apply a
/// validity quad to — buffers, heaps, pipelines — and that is the protocol
/// working, not a loss.
///
/// The two are therefore counted apart. `validity_no_surface` is the expected
/// majority; `validity_unknown_object` is a record naming an id no registry has
/// heard of. Merging them would bury the second under the first at roughly four
/// to one.
///
/// **That four-to-one is the x86 pathway's, and arm64 is not close to it.** Two
/// driven arm64/Vulkan boots read `no_surface`/`unknown` of 1342/926 and
/// 713/536 — about **1.4 to 1** on both, with the two workloads deliberately
/// different. So the majority is much thinner here, and a reader who takes the
/// ratio above as the protocol's shape will either think this pathway is broken
/// or fail to notice that it is not the same. Neither reading is available from
/// one host: the numbers are the same counters measuring the same thing, and
/// what differs is how much of a submission's residency list has already been
/// named by an executed command when the table arrives. What would still be the
/// finding on *either* pathway is the one named above — this count staying high
/// for ids that later do execute — and nothing measures that yet on either.
///
/// `validity_unknown_object` is **not** by itself a defect either, and a reader
/// scoring it needs to know why: `DeviceState::objects` is populated lazily, by
/// `objects::resolve_mapper_ref_texture` and `resolve_backing_ex` at the moment a
/// decoded command names a ref. A resource the guest has created in its own
/// object list but has not yet named in an executed stream is absent from the
/// set by construction. The table names the submission's whole residency list,
/// which is a superset of what its command buffers reference. What *would* be
/// the finding is this count staying high for ids that later do execute.
///
/// # What `set_host_valid` means, and how that is known
///
/// It licenses exactly the resources the submission stores into. That was an

/// The two length refusals the device's own framer had — "below its own header"

/// [`reims_vgpu_wire::op::op`] makes one check of both. Which of the two it was

/// **Carries one behaviour change.** A pass record shorter than

/// stencil and one colour slot — and answered the other seven slots as
/// unattached, which is indistinguishable from a guest that attached one. Apple's
/// serializer writes all 592 bytes; the short form was a tolerance for this
/// repo's own fixtures, and a truncated descriptor read as a shorter one is a
/// pass rendered with attachments the guest did not retire. `render_record`

/// vertex and instance counts are in the indirect buffer … and this rail
/// replays counts it has read".
///
/// It can be, and the reason is the argument the comment did not follow
/// through: **this rail needs the count on the CPU whatever it does.** The
/// vertex buffers are staged by extent, and the extent is a function of the
/// vertex count, so even a real `vkCmdDrawIndirect` would have had to read the
/// block to know how many bytes to stage. Once it is read, the draw is an
/// ordinary one and takes every rail an ordinary one takes.
///
/// What that costs, stated rather than assumed: the counts are a **snapshot**
/// taken when this record is decoded. A guest that writes them from a compute
/// kernel in the same submission is relying on this device having executed and
/// written back that dispatch first, which it does — compute segments complete
/// before the render stream that follows them — but it is an ordering property
/// of the device rather than of the Metal API, and a design that stopped
/// completing compute before render would break this silently.
/// Record one indirect draw, whose counts live in a guest buffer.
///
/// **Which form this is comes from the record's own variant**, not from the
/// opcode read a second time: an `IndexedIndirect` carries an `IndexRef` and a
/// `PrimitivesIndirect` does not, so "the indexed form with no index buffer"
/// and "the unindexed form" stopped being one shape with a flag beside it.
