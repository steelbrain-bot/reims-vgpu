///   work**, and every present for that surface is painting stale or black.
/// - `attempts=1`, `since_last_ms` tracking `oldest_ms` — the device asked once,
///   was refused, and **nothing has asked since**. `apply_backing` is
///   reached from the per-present path, so nothing asking means nothing is
///   presenting that surface: the guest is done with it. Nothing is lost.
///
/// This carried one number, `oldest_ms`, and its doc read it exactly backwards —

/// this device never backed". [`note_backing_fail`] used a plain `insert`, so a
/// retry *overwrote* the timestamp: an actively-retried refusal pins that age
/// near zero forever, and a large one means the retries stopped. The sentence
/// had it the wrong way round for both states, which is why the reading below

///
/// # What a driven boot reads
///
/// x86/PCI, `web-content-probe -n 10 --churn 1`, 12 951 log lines, probe green.

///   backing_fail        8
///   backing_recovered   7
///   backing_superseded  0
///   outstanding n             1      8 = 7 + 0 + 1
/// ```
///
/// Fifteen census lines for the boot, so the cadence costs nothing. The first
/// reads `oldest_ms=294` and the last `oldest_ms=14317` — which is the argument

/// flight and the other is a surface that was never backed, and the count alone
/// cannot tell them apart.
///
/// # The standing `sid=27` reading, and what it turned out to be
///
/// Three driven boots each ended with exactly one outstanding refusal, every
/// time `sid=27`, `reason=translate st=zero-pfn pte=0x0`, a 2-3 page surface, at
/// a different backing each boot. It was carried as an open question across two
/// sessions: abandoned by the guest, or a retry that never came?
///
/// **Abandoned.** It is answerable from the third boot's own census series
/// without any new signal, once `insert`'s refresh is accounted for. The 23
/// `backing_outstanding` lines run `oldest_ms` 204 → 22242 while `t` runs
/// 401037 → 423075: the two deltas are **equal at every sample**, 22038 apiece.

/// is not told, so [`crate::model::TaskResources`] goes on holding the freed
/// reference's construction and a liveness test against it would call a
/// sequence an alias.
///
/// So liveness is asked of the guest's own list, not of this device's cache:
/// the holder's *current* object-list entry is re-read and its window
/// re-derived, and the sighting stands only if that still names the very same
/// window. A holder whose slot has been overwritten, cleared, or re-pointed
/// answers with a different window or none, and the claim quietly moves to the

/// [`note_stale_task_resource`] uses to tell a recycled slot from a steady one.
///
/// One `first_sight` per distinct window, so a compositor recycling one

/// 49 is small and it is not a rounding error, because the model's list join

/// are the only ones that went stale. This guest's lists carry **one ref each**

/// `host_linear_textures`) rather than by mapping id, and neither carries a page
/// list to notice a move — so "no mapping for this task-local resource" does
/// not settle whether the re-point had anything to invalidate. It only settles
/// that the *mapping* rail had nothing.
///
/// The counters split three ways. `_unmapped_no_state` is a re-point of a
/// resource this device holds nothing for, which is genuinely a no-op — the
/// first resolve of that ref will read the page table the guest has already
/// rewritten. `_unmapped_texture_invalidated` and `_unmapped_linear_invalidated`
/// are the re-points that reached a live host copy, and they now name a repair
/// rather than a loss.
///
/// They used to be `_unmapped_texture_cache` / `_unmapped_linear_cache` and to
/// count only. A host copy whose pages the guest has re-pointed is a copy of
/// memory that is no longer the object's, and leaving it trusted served the
/// guest a stale frame from bytes it had already rewired — with nothing refusing
/// and nothing to read but these two counters. That is what they were added to
/// measure, and they measured it. Driven x86/PCI boot, `web-content-probe -n 10
/// --churn 1`, run on to a settled desktop:
///
/// ```text
///   replace_physical_unknown_object                 56
///   replace_physical_unmapped_no_state              43
///   replace_physical_unmapped_texture_invalidated   13
///   replace_physical_unmapped_linear_invalidated     0
/// ```
///
/// So roughly a quarter of the re-points reaching this branch find a live host
/// copy. The class is intermittent across boots — an earlier one on the same
/// image and probe read 8 — because it depends on which objects hold a host copy
/// at the moment the packet arrives, and the events cluster late in a boot
/// rather than during the probe.
///
/// **These are `store_routes` counters and they are per-window: sum the samples,
/// do not take the maximum.** The series descends across a boot
/// (`unknown_object` = 30, 12, 8), so a `sort -n | tail -1` reads the busiest
/// window and calls it the total — which is how this measurement was first
/// misreported as 37/32/7/1. The check that catches it is the arithmetic:
/// `no_state + texture + linear` must equal `unknown_object`. It does above
/// (43 + 13 = 56); on the maxima it did not (32 + 7 + 1 vs 37).
///
/// Re-taken on the host-pointer-import tree, same probe, 54 windows summed:
/// `17 + 7 + 0 = 24 == 24`, alongside `replace_physical_dropped` 19 and
/// `_no_pages` 5. So the identity survives the guest-memory rail change, which
/// is the plan's §7 line for it.
///
/// **A window drag cannot check this.** A `window-drag-probe` boot reads all
/// four at zero, so the identity holds as `0 == 0` and proves nothing —
/// verifying it needs `web-content-probe --churn 1`, which is what produced
/// both readings above.
///
/// `invalidate_object_host_copies` is the discharge, and it is the same one
/// `delete_object` has always performed for the same two maps — the difference
/// being that a delete also unnames the object while a re-point only moves its
/// bytes. Kept fail-visible after the repair so the reliance stays measurable;
/// a rising count is now this device correctly following the guest, and its
/// disappearance would mean the packet stopped arriving, not that the bug was
/// fixed twice.
///
/// The guest's own object list supplies the type, which is the only authority on

/// caches no copy of it. The type is on the line rather than in a counter
/// because the interesting reading is which types show up at all, and that is a

/// Several of this device's caches and generations are keyed

/// GVA writeback debt compares against, and the two host-copy caches. A
/// reference is a lawful key for those only if one allocation has one live
/// reference — and it does not. `note_backing_window_alias` found the
/// compositor holding its scanout allocation under two, so a guest write
/// declared through one reference leaves the other's generation unchanged and
/// its stale image authoritative.
///
/// The host-copy caches are fixed: a re-point now sweeps the window's peers.
/// The guest-write generation is **not**, and this is what says whether it
/// needs to be — it is bumped some six thousand times per census window, far
/// too hot to resolve a window on, so the question is asked once per distinct
/// reference.
///
/// # The reading, and why the re-key did not happen
///
/// A driven macos-15 boot asked it of **1285** distinct references and every
/// one of them was the only constructed name for its allocation
/// (`reference_storage_asked=1285`, `reference_storage_shared=0`). So the
/// `(task, reference)` key stands for storage everywhere this path uses it,
/// and re-keying it on the window would have bought nothing at a cost the hot
/// path cannot carry.
///
/// That is not the same as saying the alias does not exist — it does, and
/// `note_backing_window_alias` finds it on the compositor's scanout allocation
/// on every boot. It says the two sets do not overlap: the references that
/// share an allocation are not the references this generation is kept for.
/// Two facts, and only the measurement distinguishes them.
///
/// This stays on, at one scan per distinct reference, because the claim is
/// about a workload and not about the code: a guest that does bind two names
/// over one buffer would make the re-key necessary, and this is what would say
/// so rather than a wrong frame.
///
/// # More than one site asks it
///
/// The GVA writeback debt asks it too. `GvaResourceKey` is the resource
/// because that is what `CmdSynchronizeResources` names, and the debt it holds
/// is owed by *storage* — so a second live name over one allocation could be
/// synchronised while this one's frame stays owed, and the guest would CPU-read
/// pages the device still holds newer pixels for.
///
/// `reference_storage_asked` and `reference_storage_shared` are shared across
