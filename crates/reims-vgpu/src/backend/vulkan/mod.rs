//! Self-contained Vulkan execution backend (build-time alternate to Metal).
//!
//! Ownership mirrors [`crate::backend::metal`]: all host GPU work for this rail
//! lives under `backend/vulkan/`, driven by `ash`. Product draw encode uses the
//! internal [`engine`] (persistent ash context + content-keyed caches). This
//! crate has no external graphics-executor dependency; AIR translation comes
//! from the pinned public `metal2vulkan` crate.
//!
//! The [`Backend`] trait carries only guest-lifetime reset; the live draw seam
//! is `runtime/draw::try_metal2vulkan_draw` → [`engine::execute_draw_request`].
//!
//! [`caps`] classifies the bound host GPU into the four-cell support matrix
//! (unified/discrete memory × has/has-no DMA) that every path here must keep
//! working. Capability decisions belong there, not at call sites.
//!
//! [`translate`] is the matching seam for *state*: decoded Metal formats and
//! pipeline enums become Vulkan ones there and nowhere else, so the same
//! decision cannot be made twice with two different answers.
