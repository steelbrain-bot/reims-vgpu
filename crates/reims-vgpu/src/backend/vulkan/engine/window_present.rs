    /// for its own sake. An entry past the image count cannot acquire, so it
    /// would refuse as `busy_acquire` forever: the presenter would look like it
    /// had depth while permanently wasting its last slot, and the counter that
    /// says so is the one nobody reads when `busy_fence` is the suspect.
    ///
    /// The capped case is asserted too, and asserted as *tolerated* rather than
    /// as correct: a surface that will only give two images leaves the third
    /// entry unusable, and that is safe and self-reporting rather than a bug.
