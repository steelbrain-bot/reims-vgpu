//! Backend selection seam — **the** seam. Everything the running rail decides
//! comes through the `Backend` trait below, and nothing above this module
//! names a rail.
//!
//! - [`metal`] / [`vulkan`] are the concrete rails, feature-selected and each
//!   **self-contained** in this crate (Metal via `metal`; Vulkan via `ash` +
//!   [`vulkan::engine`]).
//! - [`SelectedBackend`] is the one that runs. `select` picks it once per
//!   process — from what the build compiled and what `REIMS_VGPU_RAIL` narrows
//!   that to — and every one of its methods forwards to the arm that is
//!   actually executing.
//! - Draws, compute, blits, mipmaps, presents, the completion stamp, the census
//!   and the host window all go through the trait. The rail-specific halves
//!   live in rail-named modules under `runtime/` (`draw::metal`,
//!   `draw::vulkan`, `compute_exec::vulkan`, …); the trait is what chooses
//!   between them.
//! - [`window`] is the neutral vocabulary the host-owned window and the rails
//!   share, and it is below both so that neither has to name the other.
//!
//! This is not a style preference. A `--backend both` binary compiles both
//! rails, so `cfg` can only ever answer "what did this build compile" — a
//! `cfg`-selected call site meaning "the Metal arm" silently disappears there,
//! and one meaning "the Vulkan arm" executes against Metal. The trait is the
//! only construct that can ask the other question.
//!
//! Metal indices/semantics are canonical (guest wire is serialized Metal).
//! Vulkan-only binding rewrites live only in [`vulkan`].

/// Declared here rather than inside `metal` — not a doc link, because that
/// module does not exist on the Vulkan arm, which is the point — and ungated,
/// for one reason: it
/// names nothing from the `metal` crate, and gating it made two test functions
/// that any host can execute run on none of them. Everything under
/// `backend/metal/` is `cfg`-ed out of the arm a Linux host builds, and
/// `cargo test --target aarch64-apple-darwin --no-run` fails at the link step —
/// so while this was a `mod hash` in that tree, the only way to run its tests
/// was to copy the file to `/tmp` and invoke `rustc --test` by hand. That is not
/// a gate, and AGENTS.md recorded it as a workaround rather than as the bug it
/// was.
///
/// The cost is a Vulkan build compiling twenty lines of arithmetic it never
/// calls, which is not a reason to hide a test from the only machine that can
/// run it.

// There is no fourth. `AGENTS.md` asks for pure logic under `backend/metal/` to

// three above are what that yielded; a survey of the rest found the remaining
// candidates blocked rather than overlooked, and it is cheaper to say so than to
// have the survey run again.
//
// Only `abi.rs`, `error.rs` and `util.rs` name nothing from the `metal` crate —
// `abi.rs`'s apparent references are `MTL*` type names in prose, and its sole
// import is `core::mem::offset_of`. All three are chained to `abi`, and `abi`
// must stay where it is: it is a **mirror of an archived C header**, its
// provenance is the point, and `protocol::dispatch` and `protocol::pass_action`
// record the reasoning. The values that are genuinely shared — the ones that
// arrive on the wire and are consumed by both backends — were already lifted
// into `contract/`, with `const` assertions in the mirror pinning the two
// spellings equal. Those assertions fire on every arm that compiles the mirror,
// including the cross-compiled `--target aarch64-apple-darwin` clippy run, so
// the mirror is not an untested file; it is tested by a mechanism `#[test]` was
// the wrong tool for.
//
// `error.rs` then cannot follow on its own, because `Status::code` is defined in
// terms of that header's `REIMS_VGPU_OK` / `_ERR_ARGS` / `_ERR_EXECUTE`, and
// re-spelling three constants out here to free five tests is the duplication
